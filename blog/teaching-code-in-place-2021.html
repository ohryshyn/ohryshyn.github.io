        <section>
          <p>
            Last year, almost at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, I
            attended a five-week Python programming course. Organized by
            Stanford University, it was available to everyone around the world.
            This course has become my starting journey into coding, which turned
            into a life-changing experience. After Code in Place, I knew not
            only how to write scripts but how to approach the problem, apply the
            logic and collaborate with international learners and teachers.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Applying as a Section Leader</h2>
          <p>
            A year has passed, and Code in Place was organized once again. The
            moment I received an email from Stanford University inviting me to
            apply as a Section Leader for
            <a href="https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/" target="_blank"
              >Code in Place 2021</a
            >, I knew that it was an opportunity not to be missed. Last year
            Code in Place gave me an astounding head start in Python, and I was
            thrilled to experience the program from the teacher’s perspective
            this time. My motivation coming into the course was simple - I
            wanted to pay back to the community that had nourished my coding
            skills at the beginning of the pandemic. And besides that,
            mentorship simply makes me happy.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a part of the application, I had to prepare a pilot video of me
            teaching and explaining a Python problem to an imaginary class! It
            was not my first time recording a video, but the thrill of sharing
            it with the Stanford committee stumbled me.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>How do I impress them?</li>
            <li>What should I say to showcase my coding experience?</li>
            <li>What teaching style should I use?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Impostor syndrome was on the radar. Not everything went smoothly at
            first. After a couple of promising attempts mumbling and trying to
            cover all possible material, I have decided to be myself and just
            roll over with the submission. I turned on the camera and started
            talking about variables and functions with passion without any
            hesitation… In the end, it turned out pretty well and lively, so I
            have submitted my application. To my surprise, the reply did not
            leave itself waiting for long. I got officially accepted as a
            Section Leader to teach Code in Place 2021 at Stanford University.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Leaders' Training</h2>
          <p>
            Right off the bat, I dived into the world of Code in Place. At the
            kick-off meeting, all Section Leaders got introduced to the
            background and principles that Code in Place was built on.
            Furthermore, we got a chance to meet face to face with all the
            amazing people who made this global initiative possible. As a part
            of the onboarding, we had two mentoring sessions that provided
            essential training on topics such as group learning, diversity,
            equity and inclusion. As my first teaching section was nigh, I felt
            well-equipped with the knowledge pouring the confidence into me. I
            got the answers to the worrisome questions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>How to capture students' attention?</li>
            <li>
              How to create an uplifting learning environment in the online
              setting?
            </li>
            <li>
              How to ensure that all students have a chance to have their voice
              heard?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For me, it became clear that
            <strong>teaching was about supporting student learning</strong>.

              Hosted on the
              <a href="https://ohyay.co/" target="_blank">OhYay platform</a>, it
              was time to start teaching. To be honest, at first, I was
              expecting that I would do a lot of lecturing. However, to my
              surprise, I was learning more than I was teaching. The
              conversations that I had with students during our weekly sections
              reminded me of the importance of the fundamental programming
              concepts. Our sections made me go back to a year ago when I was
              still embracing the Python grounds and trying to figure out why
              the console is infinitely printing the output.

            Just over five weeks, our class has leaped from zero Python
            experience to building a personal project with confidence! We have
            covered functions, control flow, decomposition and that was just the
            beginning! We have worked with images and learnt how to read and
            manipulate files. Every week, students had an opportunity to share
            feedback about the section and rate it! This feature has immensely
            helped me to continuously improve my teaching skills by adapting to
            students' needs and learning pace.

          <p>
            Moreover, to further hone the learning experience, Code in Place has
            introduced a weekly section transcript powered by AI. Besides
            allowing the review of the conversations, it showed the percentages
            of student interactions throughout the section. On top of that, it
            prompted me to reflect on the conversations while providing some
            tips for fostering communication. Even though the measure by AI was
            sometimes off, it was a nice tool to keep me aware of the section
            flow.

          <p>
            Code in Place 2021 has given me an outstanding opportunity to jump
            straight into the world of teaching. I have embraced the joy of
            sharing knowledge and felt genuine happiness seeing my students
            progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the past, I might have had some doubts about whether I wanted to
            pursue teaching education, but now I am determined that someday I
            would love to become an educator. It was the first time in my life
            that I was teaching someone in an online setting, and it will not be
            my last time supporting an initiative like this.
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest reward that I got was receiving kind words from my
            students and seeing their final projects. You could explore the
            projects

            cannot wait until the next time!
